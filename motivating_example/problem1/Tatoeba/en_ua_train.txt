You're my hero.
You're my friend.
You're lying to me.
You're lucky Tom lent you some money.
You're late.
You're just jealous.
You're insane.
You're going to love this book.
You're going to like Tom.
You're funny.
You're drunk.
You're doing fine.
You're disgusting.
You're bluffing.
You're biased.
You're annoying.
You're acting like a baby.
You're a liar.
You're a good man.
You'll be fine.
You'd better let me do that for you.
You won't find what you're looking for here.
You underestimate Tom.
You taught us that.
You stole my idea.
You sound surprised.
You smell good.
You should wash your hair.
You should probably tell Tom why he shouldn't be doing that.
You should probably tell Tom how to do that.
You should marry Tom.
You should come.
You should call Tom.
You said I was a liar.
You need to mind your own business.
You must be Tom's mother.
You must be Tom.
You may go now.
You may go home now if you like.
You look great.
You look familiar.
You know your rights.
You have three messages.
You have plenty of time.
You have no evidence.
You dropped something.
You don't scare me.
You don't need to come into the office tomorrow.
You don't look so good.
You don't have to do that today.
You don't have a choice.
You didn't call me.
You can't just leave.
You can't force Tom to do that.
You can't do this.
You can come with us.
You broke the rules.
You betrayed me.
You are such a liar.
You are going to be OK.
You are a genius.
You almost died.
Are you saying that I'm a liar?
If Tom doesn't get the job, I'll tell you.
It didn't work.
It looks like we'll get there in time.
It was a gift.
It was an accident.
It was nice talking to you.
It was Tom's idea.
It was worth a try.
It was worth it.
It won't take long.
It'll be our secret.
That didn't work.
That isn't my problem.
That sounds awesome.
That sounds exciting.
That sounds horrible.
That was very good.
That wasn't so hard.
That's a joke.
That's a myth.
That's an excellent choice.
That's an old joke.
That's cool.
That's correct.
That's fantastic.
That's for you.
That's funny.
That's interesting.
That's not even funny.
That's not my fault.
That's not my name.
That's not what Tom meant.
That's perfect.
That's stupid.
That's unacceptable.
That's very cool.
That's what friends are for.
That's what I want.
That's what Tom said.
That's wonderful.
That's your job.
That's your problem.
He wants to be different.
She wants to be different.
What happened was out of my control.
Welcome to Boston.
Warn Tom that Mary is looking for him.
Those are mine.
This was all a mistake.
This time we won.
This seems risky.
This one's yours.
This isn't funny.
This isn't for you.
This isn't as easy as it looks.
This is weird.
This is useless.
This is so weird.
This is ridiculous.
This is really bad.
This is not a game.
This is my wife.
This is my son.
This is my husband.
This is my grandfather.
This is my baby.
This is a joke.
This doesn't make sense.
They're with me.
They're not a threat.
They're lying.
They're gone.
They're expensive.
They're coming.
They're armed.
They're all scared of Tom.
They won't tell us anything.
They ruined it.
They didn't even know what to do.
They deported Tom.
There is one problem.
The room was quiet.
The room is empty.
The lid is closed.
The gun isn't loaded.
The choice is yours.
Thanks for the help.
Someone's outside.
So, you decided to come after all.
Please leave a message.
Please introduce me to your new friends.
Please help Tom.
Please don't shoot.
Perhaps you're right.
People don't like working with Tom because he's hard to get along with.
Now it's my turn.
Now I know why.
Nobody can help me.
No one said anything.
My grandfather died in Korea.
My French is a little rusty.
Maybe Tom likes you.
Maybe Tom is in love.
Mary thought she could change Tom.
Mary is so pretty.
Mary is like my own daughter.
Mary hugged her doll.
Just be patient with Tom. I'm sure he'll eventually make the right decision.
I never wanted to be a fireman.
I never want to see you again.
How interesting!
His first name was Tom.
Hey. That's not fair.
Here comes Tom.
Everything's ready.
Everyone's watching Tom.
Everyone's shocked.
Everyone's looking at Tom.
Everyone's having a great time.
Everyone's asleep.
Everyone needs friends.
Everybody's crying.
Driving relaxes me.
Do what Tom tells you to do.
Both girls laughed.
Birthdays are important.
All the boys were looking at Tom.
All the boys were dancing.
All I can do at the moment is wait.
A boy like Tom doesn't deserve a girl like Mary.
Let's share the money.
We'll talk about it tomorrow.
We'll do it tomorrow.
You have a big nose.
Wind up the clock.
When did you come?
It's a miracle!
Father is waiting.
Tom is waiting.
He is waiting.
She is waiting.
He's so young.
You don't need to wait.
I have an Italian neighbor.
I have an Egyptian neighbor.
I did what I was told.
I found it.
They found it.
I was not pleased.
This is not funny.
Can I go out to play?
She works for a bank.
Bye.
Tom is hardworking and dependable.
What on earth is this?
Take only one.
You must do as I say.
I didn't know her at the time.
They want you dead.
Do you trust Tom?
Tom has a heavy German accent.
Tom has a British accent.
You don't have any proof.
I'm bad at swimming.
Don't do two things at once.
We didn't get paid this week.
We're going to have to work together.
Is anyone looking?
Are you looking?
Have you already finished?
Please open the package.
Coffee, please.
He did it willingly.
She did it for her children.
Tom is smoking his pipe.
He got what he wanted.
Tom can't eat pork.
Do cats dream?
He made me a cake.
Tom, what are you doing?
Mary, what are you doing?
Be nicer to your brother.
Eat your veggies.
Go brush your teeth.
Stop teasing your brother!
Stop yelling!
The other children call him Fatty.
I can't wait.
I was the one who suggested it.
My sister is a moron.
You won't believe what I just saw!
She sat down next to him.
Is it new?
Do you really think that's fair?
I have never seen anything like it.
He has a fertile imagination.
Empty your pockets!
Put your hands up in the air!
Anything you say may be used against you.
We left together.
I showed her the way.
You're not my type.
Can I sleep here?
I want to go home and sleep.
I'm a bit drunk.
I don't believe Atlantis ever existed.
Please stop talking.
Here, take this.
She fell in love with a vampire.
He grabbed my arm.
I don't know where to begin.
Stop being cruel.
He was staring at her.
I'll call the chef.
I'm from the East Coast.
I'm from the West Coast.
He removed his shirt.
Do you see a rose?
How beautiful!
How clever Tom is!
How curious!
How lovely!
Keep it.
Listen.
Take it.
Tell me.
How strange!
What a big truck!
What a fool I've been!
What a smart guy!
What a strange dog!
What a strange man!
How often do you shower?
How arrogant!
That was different.
Be proud of yourself.
Nothing can stop him.
He doesn't have any real friends.
She doesn't have any real friends.
You're a wonderful friend.
I don't remember anything.
Try this.
Try some.
Call us.
Be nice.
Be kind.
Be fair.
He knows close to nothing about this issue.
Do you see the portrait?
Does your friend speak Esperanto?
It's no secret.
He wants to learn to swim.
Let's finish the job.
I visited her in Germany.
We both fell asleep.
He's a fanatic.
Do you wear glasses?
I will speak to him alone.
Stop dating losers!
I refuse to answer.
What do you want me to do, Tom?
Something's not right here.
When can I see you again?
Why would anyone do such a thing?
I can confirm this.
I cannot confirm this.
I can't confirm this.
Do I look fat?
It was not an accident.
I don't drink.
He doesn't drink.
Did you know him well?
I heard everything.
A DNA test showed he was innocent.
We laughed.
I feel like an idiot.
I felt like an idiot.
Do you disagree?
I hate sand.
What have we done?
When are we going to do it?
I think about you all the time.
I'm old.
Did you vote in the last election?
I would like to ask a question.
He kissed her.
What is your advice?
He disappeared.
Did Tom, by any chance, let Mary drive the car?
Doctor, it's the wrong leg!
Am I annoying you?
What an idiot!
Who is able to explain this to me?
Does your mother know?
What time is your train?
What time is your bus?
I love Tom.
It's simpler and more reliable.
I taught my wife how to drive.
I taught Tom how to drive.
She's intelligent and sexy.
Does she want to look at it?
There's something I have to tell you.
He's a southpaw.
Wake up Tom.
She thinks she can prove it.
You're such a liar.
She's no saint.
I'm no saint.
Tom is no saint.
She is no saint.
I got a C in English.
This is a good question.
My wife is mad.
I forgot my wife's birthday.
I forgot my own birthday!
Why do you want to help the police?
Come down here!
I owe you nothing.
I owe him nothing.
I owe her nothing.
Am I right?
I'd just like to talk.
I don't owe him anything.
I'm a police officer.
He's a police officer.
She's a police officer.
Get off my lawn.
You look like your mother.
Look at this!
We ate some turtle soup.
That's not very polite.
She's not my girlfriend.
She's not my girlfriend. She's my sister.
He's not my boyfriend.
He's not my boyfriend. He's my brother.
Do you want a massage?
Stand aside.
Give me another beer.
I'm in trouble.
He's in trouble.
I'm not your girlfriend.
I'm not your slave.
Don't look at him!
It's getting dark.
You will regret this.
She refused to pay.
I refused to pay.
I want a beer.
There's no hope.
There isn't any hope.
Let her go.
Let Tom go.
There is no hope.
I'd like to think about it a little bit longer.

Are you happy with that?
Everything will change.
What is it now?
Look at that!

I've got to speak to him.
Stop! You're tickling me!
I don't want to stop.
Stop staring.
He's too old for you.
She's too old for him.
He's too old for her.
I'm not your daughter.
I'm not your father.
I'm not your mother.
Love is not a crime.
Don't come in! I'm naked.
We did it a few times.
I did it a few times.
Very romantic!
Sometimes telling the truth hurts.
This isn't silver.
Juan doesn't know that Maria is his daughter.
She took off her clothes.
He took off his clothes.
Take off your clothes.
I feel much better already.
Their relationship isn't equal.
Religion was very important in the Middle Ages.
Can you lend me some money? I'm skint.
I have three times as many books as him.
We all know it.
Everyone knows you're rich.
You look terrible. What happened?
He told me to meet him there.
Tom is hiding under the bed.
It's no use complaining.

You can't intimidate us.
I can't just ignore Tom.
You can't just not show up.
We can't keep on fooling ourselves.
You can't kill someone that's already dead.
We can't kill Tom.
You can't kill us all.
I can't kiss you now.
I can't kiss you the way you want to be kissed.
Skip it.
I knew it!
Get a life!
I told you so.
You don't need to reinvent the wheel.
Give him an inch and he'll take a mile.

Quiet, please.
I appreciate what you did yesterday.
You're saying you wrote this book?
Did Tom talk to anyone else?
Did you kiss anybody?
Did Tom tell anyone?
Can anybody help me?
Anybody here?
Anybody hurt?

Is anybody there?
If anyone can do it, Tom can.
Anyone home?
Anyone hurt?
Do you know anyone here?
Does anybody know where Tom is?
Does anyone know what this is?
Doesn't anyone care?
I don't know anybody in Boston.
Don't open that door for anybody.
Don't tell anybody.
Don't trust anybody.
I don't usually wait for anybody.
Is there anyone here?
Ask anyone.
It could happen to anyone.

You ought to know.
I don't believe God exists.
Clearly!
Where is my son?
Let's face it: this sentence is simply bad.
I don't think he is right.
I sneeze all the time.
You're not my father.
You're very smart.
Tom loves Mary.
I'm really old.
This is my brother's.
Every person is unique.
Everyone is special.
Tom knows everybody.
I know everybody here.
Where's everybody else?

At what time is the end of the world?
Are you looking for somebody?
Did someone die?
It sounds like someone is crying.
There's someone hiding in the closet.
Somebody killed Tom.
Somebody made a mistake.
Somebody's made a mistake.
Someone opened the window.
Somebody poisoned Tom.
Somebody stole my car.
Somebody tried to kill me.
I don't know what this is.
Tom is a millionaire.
Is this enough?
There is no god.
It's not here.
This is not enough.
Where's your father now?
I can't whistle.
They took part in the assembly.
She took part in the assembly.
I love my city.
Are we mad squirrels?
Tom doesn't like chess.
Anybody can do this.
I also wanted to know.
"Never write the words ""bortsch"" and ""shchi"" in German!"
I like cookies.
Don't let the dog sleep in our bed.
I eat everything.
Sorry, but that's not what I ordered.
Stay positive.
Have you bought your Christmas gifts yet?
What have you bought your girlfriend for Christmas?
A person who chases two rabbits won't catch either.
"Why? ""Why not?"""
You slept with her?
Did you sleep with her?
Ostriches cannot fly.
When will she get home?
She suddenly kissed me.
I'm not your enemy.

Who ordered that?
Please take a seat!
The church is in the middle of the village.
You are a professor.
How come?
Have fun!
I'm buying a new car.
I'm learning Chinese.
I don't know what happened to you.
I paid in cash.
Never give up!
I was in the hospital last week.
Boys and girls play in the garden.

I hate women who say that all men are the same.
I wish I could paint like that.
Let's forget the whole thing, OK?
Do you know what love is?
I'm at the beach.
I'm feeling off colour today.
Am I allowed to use this?
I can keep a secret.
You look fat.
Do you have a copy?
I like your city.
All good things come in threes.
Water, please.
This is Italy.
Are you religious?
I quit smoking a year ago.
Why are people always so cynical?
Why are you always so cynical?
My sister started crying.
I have no clue what you're talking about.
You must be starving.
What would you do without me?
She needs to come.
Nobody encouraged him.
I want to try again.
It's a quarter to two.
He loves soccer.
He likes soccer a lot.
Even a child knows that.
Don't you agree?
We must pay taxes.
Wait a bit longer.
We must leave right away.
We are not alone.
He always leaves for work at 8:00 a.m.
He always goes to work at 8:00 a.m.
It is difficult to speak in public.
Hands off!
Do you speak Bulgarian?
I need to talk to him.
I watched it on YouTube.
And now here is my secret, a very simple secret: It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.
How are you, son?
I love to see your eyes shine when you laugh.
I need to go.
I must go.
Tell Tom that I am ready.
I am waiting for the bus.
I'm not in that much of a hurry.
Christmas comes but once a year.
Why don't you take off your coat?
Tom got scared.
The French are often wrong.
Do you know the rules of football?
John was born in the US.
It is very small.
I love my work very much.
I made a bet.
I went to the room.
Have you already started learning English?
Can I speak in English?
What do you want to say to me?
She committed suicide yesterday.
She trusted me.
Excuse me, where is the post office?
My grandfather died three years ago.
The cup was empty.
I consider Tom a friend.
Free yourself of sadness, misery and fear!
Go without me!
Apparently he wanted to distract her.
You promise?
That belongs to us.
Where is she?
The left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing.
It's already past your bedtime.
Put the book there.
“The Little Prince” is a very popular book that was translated into many languages.
Somebody saw you.
I saw somebody.
Have you seen my son?
He saw it, too.
I'll be right there.
Can I go now?
I feel powerless.
I'm just trying to survive.
He says he likes flowers.
John has a car from Japan.
I don't like silence.
I love cheese.
Are they in Paris?
I don't play tennis after school.
How could I comfort you?
He forgot to feed the dog.
What have you done with my luggage?
We need to win.
It wasn't easy.
Can I visit a church?
Stop laughing!
Which planet are you from?
I'm left handed.
She surprised me.
I know it's not easy.
I have no experience.
Do you really want to win?
Calm down, son.
It's harder than it looks.
It's easier than it looks.
I am nineteen years old.
I was frustrated.
All swans are white.
This swan is black.
You lack imagination.
He never laughs.
I miss my mom.
I want to see you in my office this afternoon.
Everyone can be mistaken.
The village needs your help.
I was flabbergasted.
Freeze!
I don't like fried fish.
I hope you'll get better soon.
This guy looks like a fox.
I need it today.
I must hurry.
I'll buy it.
We're trapped!
Stay there and don't move!
Don't mention it!
Parking prohibited!
She didn't buy bread.
I thought you hated me.
"What was that? ""Nothing."""
I ran outside.
Here's your change.
Airplanes land at airports.
Criminals should be punished.
Have they arrived yet?
I studied hard when I was in school.
I suppose you are right.
May I go?
That man is a soldier.
The book fell to the floor.
The book is on the table.
The building that I saw was very large.
The police detained several suspects for questioning.
The room was dark.
There was only one case of chicken pox at the school.
These shoes fit my feet.
They believe in God.
They may leave tomorrow.
They were members of the middle class.
We have only two dollars.
We liked the food, especially the fish.
We should study.
You must go to school.
Tom has big, blue eyes.
I like to read.
Whatever you say buddy.
Everybody ran outside.
I need an apple.
He never said that.
I'm a farmer.
Are those your bags?
Someone is looking at me.
She is teaching me.
It's a fruit.
I have to stay.
I opened all my suitcases.
Things happen.
I returned the knife that I borrowed.
He's in the hospital right now.
He's crying.
Happy holidays!
It's for you.
I don't even vote.
I can live with that.
Where does the devil live?
She's in serious trouble.
This is not my problem.
Pardon my French.
John has five apples. He gives one to Mary. How many pears are left in the bag?
Don't fix it if it ain't broke.
I like learning old languages.
Let's not forget that Tom doesn't understand French.
Tom wondered whether Mary was happy with how John had handled the situation.
It tastes like chicken.
They don't have a car.
Give it a shot.
Any questions?
I'm feeling a little under the weather today.
Having broken the mirror, Roksolana grew worried: she believed in omens, and a broken mirror promised her seven unhappy years.
Su Shi and Su Ziyou promised to remember each other every rainy night.
It rained for three days.
Spit it out!
I'm fed up with it.
I was young at the time.
I gave you my word.
Stay in the car.
I need a volunteer.
It's a delicate situation.
She invited me over for coffee.
I'm very impressed.
My hands are cold.
There is a boy.
I need to relax.
Do you want to see my room?
Maths is a good subject.
Everybody likes money.
She never saw it.
Who is that?
Who is your girlfriend?
Meow.

Tom won't do it.
Tom won't find out.
Give me a beer.
Give me ten minutes.
Have dinner with us.
Don't cross this bridge.

He's a former student of mine.
Do you like French wine?

This sounds interesting.
This sounds reasonable.
Tom is paying.

This way, gentlemen!
He gets around a lot.
Get in touch with me.
He's getting old.
I got angry.
Is there a TV in your bedroom?
He is given to lying.
We'll show Tom.
We've got nothing.
We've made it.

Come at two o'clock.
He bores everybody.
We went on foot.
I know neither of the two sisters.
You can eat as much as you want.
That's a lie.
That's so terrible.
That's so unfair.
That's the idea.
The music stopped.
Think it over.
Tom loves you.
Tom will dance.
Tom will scream.
Tom will sing.
A heavy rain fell.
All the benches are taken.
Are you interested in art?
Do it right away.
Don't be a jackass!
Don't punish the children.
Give me a dozen oranges.
Good morning.
He chose them at random.

He's a little tipsy.
He's a very energetic person.
He's always joking.
He's found a new love.
He's looking for a job.
His French is improving little by little.
Hold the rope tight.
How many digits does that number have?
Hurry up, it's late.
I don't know anything about that.
I like American movies very much.
I like folk songs.
I want to learn that song.
I'm certain he's coming.
I'm going to buy a box of matches.
I'm going to mail this letter.
I'm out of breath.
It's a cargo ship.
It's a quotation from Don Quixote.
It's a town of 3,000 people.
It's as clear as crystal.
Let's drink to your health!
Light the candle.
Look how that ball bounces.
My watch is five minutes fast.
She fell down the stairs.
She lives far from there.
Tell me frankly.
That's a separate question.
The beer's very cold.
The lights went out.
The patient got worse.
The suit's made of very rough material.
There it is!
There was a calm after the storm.
These oranges are very sour.
These ties are very expensive.
They've fired him.
This bucket leaks.
This street used to have another name.
We expect him tomorrow at ten o'clock.
We have to notify the police.
We live in the center of the city.
What a hot day!
What are we having for supper?
What time does the mailman come?
Yesterday they fired seven employees.
You're aiming too low to hit the target.
My family is very proud of me.
She eats chocolate every day.
You want it, don't you?
Is your wife tall?
Can your wife drive?
What color are your wife's eyes?
Is your wife good at cooking?
Does your wife work?
Now do you understand?
Take what you want.

He started to cry.
Your cat is fat.

Please hurry. We're late already.
From above, one could see the river.
Give this to Tom.
Go and fetch Tom.
Have you forgiven Tom?
His name is Tom.
His real name's Tom.

Is Tom still sleeping?
Is Tom still up?
It could be Tom.
It sounds like Tom.
It was Tom's fault.
It's important to Tom.
Just let Tom go.
Let's go find Tom.
Maybe Tom was right.
Please don't tell Tom.
That's what Tom says.
That's what Tom wants.
That's where Tom lives.
They don't like Tom.
They're Tom and Mary.
This is for Tom.
This is from Tom.
Tom agrees with me.
Tom already told me.
Tom and Mary agree.
Tom hit me.
Tom is mad.
Tom is serious.
Tom is terminal.
I love my country.
Tom has arrived in Boston.
Tom, we've arrived!
My French is terrible.
The food here is terrible.
Tom made a terrible decision.
Tom, you look terrible.
You understand German, right?
Get out of here!
She never gets invited to parties.
Who's that cute guy?
That's Tom's girl.
It could happen to anybody.
Aim higher.
Do you sell alarm clocks?
Don't act like a child.
Never again will I make that mistake.
A stranger approached him.
Admission is free.
Are you going for a walk?
As you like.
Control yourself!
I'm really sorry to hear that.
You don't know what you're missing.
You're just like your father.
Cyprus was a British protectorate.
Do you have any identification?
Do you understand French?
Don't be a baby.
Don't disturb me!
Don't talk to the driver.
Everything remains as it was.
Find out what hotel they're living at.
Four plus three is seven.
Give him my regards.
Good evening!
Have you learned to drive a car?
He belongs to the diplomatic corps.
He bought two horses at the fair.
He changed his mind daily.
He died last year.
He has a strange name.
He has very bad luck.
I can do this myself.
I did it quickly.
I do things in my own way.
I don't feel like working.
I don't know exactly.
I don't know where they hid the key.
I gave my word.
I go to the movies every week.
I got what I wanted.
I have a good job.
I like chocolate ice cream.
I like French cooking.
I want to be paid in cash.
I woke up at sunrise.
I'll do it later.
I'll wear a white dress.
I'm at your service.
I'm counting on your help.
I'm indebted to you.
I'm very cold.
I've been waiting a long time for you.
Is this the Department of Labor?
Is tomorrow a holiday?
Is your name on the list?
It was an informal meeting.
It'll surely rain today.
It's raining very hard.
It's the best house in town.
Knock before entering.
Let's go to the theater together.
Let's talk seriously.
Monday's a holiday.
None of my friends know.
One of my best friends has failed me.
Put the vegetables in the strainer.
Show this gentleman the way.
So long.
Spanish is spoken in Central and South America.
Speak to the manager.
Take this chair. It's sturdy.
That doesn't matter to me.
That rule applied to everybody.
The airplane was flying above the clouds.
The bottle contained wine.
The ceremony was impressive.
The enemy attacked from behind.
The pie's delicious.
The plane still hasn't taken off.
The prospects aren't very bright.
The road's in bad condition.
The signature was forged.
The soup's cold.
The water began to boil.
Then we went to the theater.
There's no way to translate it.
These ties aren't mine.
These windows aren't clean.
The box, which I had found was empty.
This annoys me very much.
This chair is uncomfortable.
Those aren't mine.
Turn on the gas.
We finished the work.
We have to make a decision.
Doesn't it taste good?
Doesn't Tom like girls?
Don't be a chicken.
It doesn't matter now.
It doesn't mean anything.
Tom, don't leave.
A language is a dialect with an army and a navy.
She does not listen.
She doesn't listen.
He does not listen.
He doesn't listen.
We don't have another choice.
Now or never.
I'm going to shoot him dead.
We must hurry or else the shop will be closed.
We'll meet in the theater.
What a pretty woman!
What page are you on?
What's the scale of this map?
When's dinner served?
Where does that bus go?
Where's that movie showing?
Where's the exit?
Who is that guy?
Don't be like that.
Don't be so melodramatic.
Don't bother me now.
Don't change the channel.
Don't count on it.
Don't ever think that.
Don't forget to vote.
There were no survivors.
Don't look at Tom.
Don't look for us.
Don't say a word.
Don't you like Boston?
Who's that boy?
Why don't you trust me?
Will you pay cash?
You're a coward!
Tom and Mary usually speak to each other in French.

We were waiting.
Why don't you trust us?
Nobody understands us.
Tom rarely eats breakfast with us.

Do you like them?
Ask them.
Did you really not know that?
Did Tom ask you to do that?
Why are we doing that?
Why are you reading that?
Why are you asking me that?
We already knew that.
Stop talking about that.
No one has ever complained about that.
I knew you wouldn't want to do that.
It'll be difficult to do that.
I can't promise that.
I want to become a better teacher.
Which do you drink more, coffee or tea?
We will succeed.
We're not that stupid.
Perhaps you should stop.
What's that awful sound?
You'll be sorry.
You should've told me sooner.
This is my favorite song.
This is the solution.
I major in sociology.
I thought so.
Was Tom sleeping?
Stop singing.
Is it really that simple?
The explanation is simple.
Do you think it's a sign?

I have my reasons.
I love to read.
Do I have to answer that question?
It's difficult to answer that question.
Was Tom punished?
Tom was punished.
This time we have proof.
Keep your promises.

Tom earns a lot of money.
Where were you last Monday?
Do I have to come on Monday?
See you Monday.
Yesterday was Monday.
I have to come on Monday.
I want my mom.
You're probably mistaken.
Someone made a mistake.
Don't misbehave.
Tom's parents are older than mine.
Why did they change their minds?
Did you change your mind?
I like milk.
I saw the message.
How did you and your wife meet?
Yeah, that's what I meant.
Who saw me?
Do you think Tom saw me?
Tom, can you hear me?
Were you listening to me?
I know you're thinking about me.
You aren't me.
Get a ticket for me.
Tom waited for me.
You always lie to me.
Come run with me.
No one came with me.
What're they going to do to Tom and Mary?
Are you already married?
Tom is a dangerous man.
Am I in love?
I've seen a lot.
Tom knew where Mary lived.
All you have to do is listen.
I don't want to lie.
I'll write you a letter.
Tom is very lazy.
I don't like to laugh.
I was really late.
I'm always late.
I think that's common knowledge.
What do we need to know?
Do you have a knife?
Nobody knew.
I love apple juice.
Of course I was joking.
I miss your jokes.

We have to do it.
We can do it.
I'd do it.
I loved it.
I don't want to interfere.
The situation hasn't improved.
Do you want to go hunting?
I've already done my homework.
Luckily, you were at home.

Did you help?
Listen, I need your help.
I'll see if I can help.

My parents will be happy.
It still happens.
I'll wait in the gym.
Of course, I feel guilty.
It's great.
Your new guitar sounds good.
Where do they want to go?
I brought you a gift.
What are you running from?
Who are you running from?
What's Tom running from?
Are they your friends?
When did you become friends?
We're very good friends.
Are you still studying French?
I think Tom knows French.
What am I doing this for?
What are we looking for?
I'm not interested in football.
We want more food.
These aren't fish.
I was there first.
I fell.
It was probably my fault.
What don't you like about your family?
Tom and Mary are like family.
That wouldn't be fair.
I heard the explosions.
Tom has unrealistic expectations.
There are always exceptions.
What do you need exactly?
Have you understood everything?
Did you understand everything?
I've already told you everything.
Tom has escaped.
Do you understand English?
I'm still eating.
I don't want to eat.

Well done.
What are you girls doing?
Tom has a white dog.
What does Tom want to do?
Don't you know what to do?
What does Tom want me to do?
Have you decided what you'll do?
What does that thing do?
Do what you want to do.
We don't have anything to do.
This is what I have to do.
Yeah, that's what I'll do.
Yeah, that's what I'd do.
I washed the dishes.
I was very disappointed.
Tom made dinner.
Love doesn't die.
Do you have diabetes?
It's what we deserve.
I think it's a fair decision.
Is this your daughter?
Tom didn't cry.
I want an ice cream.
They live in another country.
It was pretty cool.
I'm not too convinced.
Is this confusing?
You signed a confession.
You shouldn't have signed a confession.

Why did you leave Boston?
I'd love to visit Boston.
Tom doesn't want to go to Boston.
Come with me to Boston.
See you in Boston.
I was in Boston.
Have fun in Boston.
Tom was born here in Boston.
I've just arrived in Boston.
I knew you'd like Boston.
Where's your boss?
This movie is boring.
Let's write a book.
Tom was a blackmailer.
My favorite subject is biology.
I don't have a bike.
I'll come by bicycle.
It could've been better.
I wanted the best.
Where is my beer?
Are you still in bed?
This is really beautiful.
Why are you barefoot?
I don't trust banks.
That's my favorite band.
Where's the ball?
I have too many bags.
This tastes bad.
The results were bad.
Is it far away?
The bird flew away.
Maybe I threw it away.
I don't want to go away.
We're awake.
When did you come to Australia?
When did you arrive in Australia?
Let's go back to Australia.
We bought this in Australia.

Where are we?
Tom is eating an apple.
Just apologize.
You should at least apologize.
Here's the key to my apartment.
Mary is too young for me anyway.
Do we have to pay anything?
Do you think that will change anything?
Tom won't be able to tell us anything.
I didn't show them anything.
I'm not understanding anything.
I didn't understand anything.
I can't help anyone.
It could be anyone.
I don't trust you anymore.
Don't do that anymore.
You can't do that anymore.
We're not friends anymore.
I guess I'm a little antsy.
I didn't expect you to answer.
It was a good answer.
It's really very annoying.
I like to watch anime.
Tom was very angry.
I understand your anger.
This is simply amazing.
Are you as tired as I am?
Tom is so much older than I am.
I know that already.
Leave it alone.
Tom wanted to be left alone.
I have to go alone.
I hate you all.
Now I understand it all.
Tom didn't mention Mary at all.
I'm not surprised at all.
I wasn't scared at all.
I reluctantly agreed.
Did everyone agree?
You have to try again.
I don't want to ever see you again.
You're telling lies again.
Tom won again.
I trust your advice.
We want some advice.
They're adorable.
This is an adjective.
You look like an actress.
Do I look like an actor?
What more can be said?
My greatest fear is drowning.
Tom wants to say goodbye.
Tom still doesn't know the truth.
My grandfather was a hero.
My friends are very loyal.
My children don't listen to me.
Your dreams will come true.
Tom will be very pleased.
Tom never killed anybody.
My wife is having a baby.
My neck hurts a little.
My name should be on that list.
My family's going to love you.
My customers never complain.
My birthday's not for another month.
My appointment is at 2:30.
My apartment is in that building.
This is not my cup of tea.
They betrayed Tom.
Is this your real name?
I speak five languages.
I want a new dog.
You eat.
We eat.
Excuse me, how much is this?
Excuse me, how much does this cost?
How much is this umbrella?
What's the price of this umbrella?
Fair enough.
What is permitted to Jove is not permitted to an ox.
I left my credit card at home.

Do you think it's a bad thing?
Add this to my bill.
I'm angry with you.
I've already tried.
I love strawberries.
I'm a tourist.
Why do you know that?
Just to be on the safe side, why don't you take an umbrella with you?
Why are you so smart?
Tom was killed in battle.
Don't talk to your mother like that!
Who bought you this?
Does it taste good?
I think Tom and Mary like each other.
He dived.
Water is life.
She is in great danger.
Let me sleep for another ten minutes.
You went too far.
You will laugh.
Hello again!
It's impossible to fix.
You agree with Tom, don't you?
It's really annoying.
If something's happened to him, I'd like to know.
Nothing's sacred.
My name is not really Tom.
It was a Saturday night.
New opportunities are opening up to you.
My brother's in Australia now.
Do you want to sing?
Do you want to live in Boston?
Do you want to drink anything?
You're a good actress.
I'll find it sooner or later.
Duty calls.
They're so stupid.
They promised.
She has more money than brains.
Is this computer connected to the Internet?
I don't speak Albanian.
I just finished doing it.
His mother was very superstitious.
Which browser is your favourite?
Tom arrived first.
We found her.
We found him.
I tell you the truth.
Greece is bankrupt.
He left an umbrella in the bus.
I'm waiting for my turn.
Maybe I should have spoken with Tom.
Are you Hungarian?
I'm not Hungarian.
Martha loves you.
This is not a secret.
Women aren't interested in him.
Nothing is working.
The boy is picking yellow flowers.
I do not work on Sunday.
That is my house.
We're from Germany.
We're both from Boston.
Tom is helping her.
Here's your tea.
Tom asked Mary to help.
I've seen you with her.
I can't work with them.
Did you get in touch with him?
I just talked with him.
I must talk with them.
I want you to stay with him.
I spoke with them today.
I think I'm in love with him.
I think I'm in love with her.
I don't want to go with him.
What's that got to do with you?
It has nothing to do with her.
I'll deal with him myself.
I'm going to Boston with you.
We've got to warn her.
I'll warn him.
We did warn her.
What did you want her to do?
I don't want him to know this.
Did you understand him?
No one trusts you.
No one trusts him.
No one trusts her.
They trust him.
They trust her.
You shouldn't trust her.
Have you told him already?
I haven't told him.
I haven't told her.
I told him I was married.
I've written to him.
Talk to her.
What did you talk to him about?
We really need to talk to you.
I still need to talk to him.
I don't want to talk to him.
I don't want to talk to her.
What did you say to her?
I'll explain it to him.
What'll they do to you?
No one pays attention to her.
Did you say anything to him?
I have more money than you.
I have more money than her.
Tell him it's a priority.
Tell him I'm in the office.
I'll have to tell him.
I didn't tell him that.
Don't tell her.
You can tell them I said so.
That isn't her.
I'm going to surprise him.
I'll surprise them.
I'll surprise him.
I'll surprise her.
I'll send her a postcard.
Have you seen him yet?
Have you seen her yet?
I haven't seen him today.
I haven't seen him since.
Nobody's seen him.
Nobody's seen her.
No one's seen her.
I've only seen him twice.
I've never seen him like that.
I've never seen her like that.
No one has seen her.
