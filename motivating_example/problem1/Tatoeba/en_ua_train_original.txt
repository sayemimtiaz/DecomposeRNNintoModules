They're expensive.
They're coming.
They're armed.
They ruined it.
They deported Tom.
The gun isn't loaded.
Thanks for the help.
Please leave a message.
Please help Tom.
Perhaps you're right.
Now it's my turn.

Coffee, please.
Do cats dream?
Tom, what are you doing?
Be nicer to your brother.
Go brush your teeth.
I can't wait.

It was not an accident.
I heard everything.
A DNA test showed he was innocent.
We laughed.
Do you disagree?
I hate sand.
What have we done?
I'm old.
Did you vote in the last election?
I would like to ask a question.
He disappeared.
What an idiot!
Who is able to explain this to me?
I love Tom.
It's simpler and more reliable.
I taught my wife how to drive.
You're such a liar.
This is a good question.
I owe you nothing.
I owe him nothing.
I owe her nothing.
Am I right?
I don't owe him anything.
Do you want a massage?
Stand aside.
Don't look at him!
It's getting dark.
You will regret this.

He's started writing a novel.
She raised her hands.
No one uses that word anymore.
No one thinks that way anymore.
No one comes to visit me anymore.

She's too old for him.
I'm not your daughter.
I'm not your father.
I'm not your mother.
Don't come in! I'm naked.
Very romantic!
This isn't silver.
Take off your clothes.

Tom can't do that.
I can't eat chicken.
I can't eat.
I can't feel my toes.
I can't hear a word.
You can't help me.
We can't help Tom.
Tom can't help you now.
Tom can't help you.
Who should I vote for?
I can't imagine a day without you.
You can't intimidate us.
You can't kill someone that's already dead.
We can't kill Tom.
I can't kiss you the way you want to be kissed.
Skip it.
I knew it!
Get a life!
Give him an inch and he'll take a mile.

I can't stop thinking about Tom.
I can't talk now.
I can't tell you where Tom lives.
I can't wait forever.
I can't wait until tomorrow.
Can it wait?
He looks like a monkey.
I never said no.
I didn't mean to kill him.
I didn't mean to hit him.
I only drink water.
He's a bit jealous.
Are you still there?
You're lying!
She's lying on the floor.
You're not telling the truth.
I'm going on vacation next week.
Women and children first!
He lives in an apartment.

It was a stupid idea.
I don't work here.
Is it safe?
It doesn't hurt at all.
It happens all the time.
I was the only man.
Am I disturbing anything?
It's rather ironic.

I went swimming in the river.
I have enough money to buy it.
It is in the kitchen.
She's younger than me.
I read a lot.
How many boys are in this class?

There's someone hiding in the closet.
Somebody killed Tom.
Somebody made a mistake.
Somebody's made a mistake.

Who ordered that?
I'm learning Chinese.
I paid in cash.
Never give up!
I was in the hospital last week.
Are you in a bad mood?
Are you still sleepy?
It snowed yesterday.
Sweden's population is growing.

I hate women who say that all men are the same.
I wish I could paint like that.
Do you know what love is?
You look fat.
I like your city.
Water, please.
This is Italy.
Are you religious?
Why are people always so cynical?
My sister started crying.
It's a quarter to two.
He loves soccer.
He likes soccer a lot.
Even a child knows that.
Don't you agree?
We must leave right away.
He always goes to work at 8:00 a.m.
It is difficult to speak in public.
Hands off!
Do you speak Bulgarian?
I need to talk to him.
How are you, son?
I am waiting for the bus.
I'm not in that much of a hurry.
Why don't you take off your coat?
It is very small.
What do you want to say to me?
The cup was empty.
I consider Tom a friend.
You promise?
That belongs to us.
Where is she?
Somebody saw you.
I saw somebody.
He saw it, too.
I feel powerless.
I love cheese.
He forgot to feed the dog.
What have you done with my luggage?
It wasn't easy.
She surprised me.
Calm down, son.
I am nineteen years old.
I was frustrated.
All swans are white.
This swan is black.
You lack imagination.
He never laughs.
The village needs your help.
Freeze!
I need it today.
I must hurry.
I'll buy it.
Parking prohibited!
I thought you hated me.
I ran outside.
Here's your change.
I suppose you are right.
That man is a soldier.
The book is on the table.
The police detained several suspects for questioning.
There was only one case of chicken pox at the school.
They believe in God.
They were members of the middle class.
We have only two dollars.
We should study.
You must go to school.
Everybody ran outside.
I'm a farmer.
It's a fruit.
I returned the knife that I borrowed.
He's crying.
I don't even vote.
I can live with that.
Pardon my French.
I like learning old languages.
Let's not forget that Tom doesn't understand French.
It tastes like chicken.
Any questions?
It rained for three days.
I was young at the time.
I gave you my word.
I need a volunteer.
It's a delicate situation.
My hands are cold.
There is a boy.
Do you want to see my room?
Everybody likes money.
Who is your girlfriend?
Meow.
I like your website.
That explains a lot.
Me too!
I knew it would happen sooner or later.
I think about him a lot.
That book is old.
It won't happen to me.
There are exceptions.
It's a fish.
It was hard to believe.
It's hard to believe.
I'm very proud of my son.
I'm very proud of my daughter.
How was the wedding?
I was shaken.
How old is she now?
Are we broke?
This is not funny!
This is my final offer.
They just left.
He just left.
You're not normal.
She's loaded.
I can't accept this.
Keep driving.
He will be here today.
They don't know yet.
He doesn't know yet.
We were always together.
I hate shopping.
I tried everything.
Your mother is going to kill me.
I hate spinach.
You can sleep on the couch.
Honey, I love you.
I have to work tomorrow.
Hurry up, girls, you're going to be late.
Hurry up, guys.
This is a miracle.
Who are you trying to convince?
We were both drunk.
They were both drunk.
Don't interfere.
Don't interrupt.
Help us.
It's acceptable.
It's awesome.
It's awful.
It's broken.
It's clean.
It's delicious.
It's forbidden.
It's green.
It's immoral.
It's improbable.
It's irrelevant.
It's morning.
It's night.
It's obsolete.
It's his.
It's ready.
It's sufficient.
It's unforgettable.
It's unnecessary.
It's upstairs.
It's urgent.
It's Wednesday.
It's yours.
Let's pray.
Listen closely.
That's acceptable.
That's evident.
That's fun.
That's logical.
That's ludicrous.
That's him.
That's her.
That's his.
That's hers.
That's unfair.
That's wise.
Tom screamed.
Tom understood.
You've misunderstood.
Why don't you tell me about it?
Enjoy your meal.
Two beers please.
I don't know him very well.
She'll understand.
He'll understand.
Try not to worry.
No one can replace you.
We drank all night.
I just don't get it.
Nobody deserves that.
We grew up together.
He's a dumb-ass.
Have you seen enough?
My cat is happy.
That's not the only problem.
War is hell.
Is that your sister?
I'm not joking.
People are more important than money.
Where did you park the car?
How many counties are there in Florida?
How many teams are there?
You think you're funny?
Would you like to sing?
This is a disaster.
He only cares about himself.
The price of coffee went down.
I love her sister very much.
It's against my principles.
He's not perfect.
He isn't perfect.
Everybody hates me.
I promised my parents I wouldn't drink.
Give me your keys.
I don't have the slightest clue.
I was sad.
Our time is limited.
I was lying.
I was singing.
Tom is adorable.
We're adventurous.
I'm adventurous.
Tom is afraid.
We're afraid.

Tom is agitated.
You're ambitious.
I'm amused.
